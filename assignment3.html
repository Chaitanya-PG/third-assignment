	Chaitanya's life has been very simple. She was born in Kerala on 4th November 1992 in Trivandrum. She was named "Chaitanya P G". She relocated to Delhi in 6 months i.e. 12th May 1993. Her education started from a prenursery school "Babyland". For her nursery she was transferred to "St. Marys School". She finally began her first standard from "Nutan Vidya Mandir" school. She was very good in her studies with her parents' help. She made lots of friends there. But since the friend circle increased hence she was not concentrating much on her studies hence her parents transferred her to another school for her ninth which is "Greenfields Public School". She did her matriculation from that school and further got transferred to a new school "Taksila Public School" from where she completed her Intermediate level.
	<br>
	<br>
	Now a new life began which came out to be a college life. She went to Maharaja Agarsain Institute of Technology for higher studies. She enjoyed her college life a lot. She studied, travelled, bunked, played and spent a very happy life in her four years graduation period. She completed her B.Tech in Electronics & Communication Engineering. With all the college memories and friends she then took her next step of working in a reputed company.
	<br>
	<br>
	She started working in a company named "Mphasis Pvt. Ltd." She worked there for sometime and in the mean time came a marriage proposal and as all went well, she got married on 24th April 2015. Soon after the marriage she relocated to an international location "Dubai". She lived there for three years and also gave birth to a beautiful baby and named him "Hrithvik K C". She worked in Dubai in a passport and visa company working for the Indian Embassy, "BLS International". She now returned back to Delhi and started working in "The Yogshala" as a Public Relations Officer. She is leading a happy and wonderful life today.
